# Dear Data 
(Please note: this is a school project with creative liberties. Proceed with caution.)

Welcome to the chaos! I'm still learning how to use Markdown, but it is a lot of fun seeing all the little details come together.
Speaking of little details, I had the privilege to do a fun project known as the Dear Data Postcard! 

What is it, you might be wondering? Well...think of combining both analytical and creative abilities and putting it 
all on an 8.5"x5.5" card. The project was originally conceived by two awesome women, Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec,
who sent each these postcards for a whole year between two continents. The cards were also a great way to analyze and record
data about themselves from everyday life. I seriously recommend checking this [project](http://http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) out.

As for myself, I decided to do something that would be simple yet analytical. I recorded data of one of greatest gifts mankind has 
discovered: coffee. Yeah, that makes me sound basic, but I can live with that. For about a week, I kept track of how much coffee I
consumed each day. Surprise! I drink quite a bit.

The backside of the card is also important. It provides a legend for the frontside and go into more detail about your project.
Here, I used an *xy axis* to show my coffee-drinking habits, with *x* representing the days of the week and *y* representing
how much coffee per cup I am drinking per day. According to the graph, I drank 13 cups total in the recorded data, which averages 
to about 1.8 cups of coffee a day.

While this was fun, I did unfortunately had to cut out a lot of information. It mostly had to do with the size of the container,
what type of coffee I was drinking (sometimes I need espresso), what time I was drinking the coffee, and so many other factors I
couldn't include. This is the con of working with limited data, and something all info-specialists should keep in mind.

That's about it. Now you know about the Dear Data Postcard Project and how much coffee I drink per week. Judge me as you please. :coffee:
