# Tool Review: Palladio

Palladio is a free, open-access tool that is also the product of a grant given to the Stanford Department of Humanities and Design. 
Palladio’s purpose is to analyze relationships across space and time through data points. Through relatively easy-to-use tabs and options, 
the design of the map can become a colorfully detailed presentation. It even comes with a free dataset, Mapping of the Republic of Letters,
a collection of letters from the intellectuals of Europe and early America created by Stanford.

One of the aspects that I appreciate about Palladio is its open access to the general public. There is nothing to pay for, download, or 
sign up for. It has a sample dataset for those who may not understand the program. The options used to create the appearance of the map 
are fairly easy to figure out. For instance, I played with the “places of birth” and “places of death” in the Map Layers under the Map tab.
Connecting those two points only took a couple minutes. Another point that can be played with is the “arrival” point of the letters.
You can even make the points and links different colors and change how the map looks just under the Map Layers tab! 
The emphasis of this review might be more on the visual side of things, but I also wish to touch on the other parts of this program.
The names of the senders and the recipients and their gender can be shown by using the Table Tab. You can find when the letters were 
found under the Timeline. You can also find the age and time these writers were alive under the Timespan, which is a different
presentation of the Timeline. I personally found the Timespan easier to read.
	
Some of the downsides of Palladio include the crudeness of the simplicity. Sometimes the downside of free open access is 
that the program is limited to what is put into it. As mentioned, Palladio exists because of a grant, but it was only funded 
from July 2013 – June 2016. I really do not want to blame Palladio’s simplicity on a lack of money. Many great projects have been 
made with little to no money, so let’s throw the concept of money out the metaphorical window! Also, I prefer simplicity in a program, 
coming from the perspective of someone who knows next to nothing about programming and technology. Another part of this limitation is
the basic fact that most people do not know how to transport a dataset into a visual program, if they even know how to create a dataset 
to begin with, which is why it is helpful to have a sample set for people to play with. I would argue that Palladio limits itself with 
just having one sample dataset, but that would undercut the expansive amount of information that particular dataset contains.
	
In general, I recommend Palladio for those who wish to learn how digital visualization works and those who want to create a 
simple map for their projects. As for more advanced programmers, you could use Palladio, but I think you would prefer something 
more challenging and more detailed.
