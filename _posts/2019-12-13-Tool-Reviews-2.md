## Tool Review: Webrecorder

This is for all the archivers who download videos, articles, and webpages to preserve them for the name of Internet History! 
I see you, and you are welcome here. Today we will be discussing Webrecorder. Webrecorder is a tool that “records” web pages and archives 
them in the most dynamic state that it can be. It is a project by Rhizome, an online organization that champions preserves digital art, 
and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, an organization whose goal is to preserve the humanities. Going off these organizations’ 
goals, Webrecorder is best used to archive and preserve parts of the internet. The Internet is forever, but it is also full of dead links 
and missing pages. The duty of archiving these pages falls onto the average person who feels the desire to preserve the web, 
specifically their favorite website or forum, which is a valid duty for those reading who feel this desire.

How Webrecorder works is you sign up for an account on webrecorder.io, pick a web browser (it’s either Chrome or Firefox) and the url 
for the site you want to record, and you can start recording from there. You can keep up to 5GB of recorded material on the website, 
which you can then download the files onto your computer using their app, Webrecorder Player. It’s a very straightforward, easy-to-use 
app that lets you view your files offline. The point is, Webrecorder is usable by even the most inept of computer users.

Now for the downside: it will not capture what you do not click. For instance, I used a WikiHow article about growing sage. There were 
two hyperlinks on that page, one about growing plants from cut pieces, and the other about testing soil pH. I clicked on the cut plant
link and went down that short rabbit hole, thus documenting those connections. However, I left the pH page out of the archive. It might
not seem like a big deal at the time, but when I went back to view it and clicked on “pH,” nothing was there, obviously because it was 
not recorded. So, in order to archive everything, you have to click and record every page on the site! It is a tedious job, even for 
those passionate to preserve the Internet. Unless you are trying to archive an entire website and its hyperlinks, I doubt there is much
to be concerned about.

So in general, Webrecorder is the perfect tool for preserving those web pages that matter most to you, whether that’s important forum 
threads or one of those weird, one-off sites like isthisemo.com (which ironically no longer exists as of last month) that we have all 
encountered at least once in a while. Just keep in mind that if you want to archive the whole web page in the most amount of detail,
be prepared and willing to archive everything about it. It’s the great way to preserve and protect information in the name of Internet 
History!
